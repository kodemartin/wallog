**wallog** is a simple, themeable, hopefully modular, blog management system, inspired by [PicoCms](http://picocms.org/) and mainly targeted to developers. Just clone it, change `config.php` and `prefs.php` and start adding content in this folder. Every post is a seperate file, and formatting is done using [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

Metadata goes in a comment block at the top of each file.
